Change the number of posts displayed in individual category archives and their feeds--independently of each other.

== Description ==

With WordPress, you have the ability to change the number of posts that appear in a typical loop or in a feed, but it's a global change that affects every loop or feed on your site. Posts Per Category remedies that at the category level, giving you control over the number of posts that appear on a category archive page *or* in a category feed. You just choose a category, enter the number of posts you want to show on the archive page and in the feed, and click "Save." It's that easy.

Posts Per Category was originally created to allow Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income to change the number of items that appeared in his podcast category feed. Listeners were wondering why they couldn't see more than the ten latest episodes of his popular podcast in iTunes. The reason turned out to be that his podcast category feed was limited by the global setting in the Reading panel. He couldn't change that number without changing the length of every single feed in WordPress and there didn't appear to be any solutions available, which is why he worked with us to create Posts Per Category.

== Installation ==

Installing Posts Per Category is just like installing most other plugins. [Check out the codex](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins) if you have any questions.

After installation, you can find the Posts Per Category settings under the main Settings menu item in your admin panel, or as an alternative, you can edit categories directly to change the settings. Take a look at the screenshots for an example.
